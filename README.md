# discord-rpc.net
This is my design for a C# wrapper around Discord's RPC library. It embeds all the necessary code into the output DLL so no external files are required. It currently only supports Windows but the framework is there to easily add support for Linux and OS X in the same library, making it fully portable across platforms.
